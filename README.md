(1question)- For each record in wikilinks , extract The URL of the page ((annotated by â€œURL) and all the urls of
the websites that this page links to (annotated by MENTION). That means, you want to create an
RDD of the form (<URL1>,< URL2>) where URL1 is the URL of the page and URL2 is the URL of a
page mentioned /linked to by URL1.
For example, if have the following record in wikilinks:
URL ftp://217.219.170.14/Computer%20Group/sattari/word
MENTION vacuum tube 421 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube
MENTION vacuum tubes 10838 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube
Then you want to create a pair rdd with the following elements:
(ftp://217.219.170.14/Computer%20Group/sattari/word,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube)
(ftp://217.219.170.14/Computer%20Group/sattari/word,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube)
(2question)- Find the number of times each URL has been mentioned by another URL and find 10 most
frequently mentioned URLS.
(3question)- Find the number of symmetric URL pairs <URL1,URL2> such that URL1 mentions URL2 and URL2
mentions URL1 . (Is there any such symmetric pairs in wikilinks?)
